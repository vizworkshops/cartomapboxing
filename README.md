# cartomapboxing

Landing page for a Carto and Mapbox workshop given as part of the VKC Libraries Data and Visualization workshop.



This workshop walks through the process of creating an interactive map using multiple layers of data in CARTO. In addition, participants will learn how to use Mapbox to create a historical baselayer that can then be used within CARTO. 

Data used in the workshop includes custom CSV files of locations found in the historical Greenbook. Boundary files outlining Home Owner's Loan Corporation, historical Home Owner's Loan Corporation map, and present day Los Angeles County neighborhood files created by the Los Angeles Times.

## Access to Data:

For this project we will use a collection of different types of data:

* points 
* polygons
* raster image

You will get a basic understanding of these types of different data and how they can be mapped.

All files are located in this google drive:

**CSV files (points)**

CSV files with locations of places listed in the GreenBook. Special thanks to Professor Genevieve Carpio at UCLA and student research assistant Jose Cardona for creating and sharing the data. Jose compiled the data for these two sheets last year while doing research for an ongoing project. We used google sheets to store the data and a script that plugs into google sheets to geocode the addresses. Each address was manually transcribed by Jose from the NYPL GreenBook website - https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green-book#/?tab=about - then checked against current street data to verify each location.

**Boundary Files (polygons)**
These files show distinct boundaries with associated metadata. The HOLC_LosAngeles.geojson files is a geojson file which is a geographic encoding format. The la_county-neigbhorhoods-v6.zip file contains a shapefile, which is a vector data format developed by ESRI. The shapefile format requires specialized software to be opened. CARTO allows for shapefiles (up to a certain size) to be uploaded as long as they are zipped.

**Historical Maps (Raster)**
These maps are already geo-referenced. This means that they have been processed using GIS software so that they have been associated or pinned to real world locations. The files are all .tiff files that have been geo-referenced.
